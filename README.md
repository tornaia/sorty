# <tt style="color:limegreen">Sorty</tt> - Media sorting

<tt style="color:limegreen">Sorty</tt> is about organizing private images and videos. It is not providing just a view based on the metadata but it persists the result to the disk in a structured way by using directories, subdirectories so you are not bound to any applications anymore.

It is just a PoC and not something ready for production use.
